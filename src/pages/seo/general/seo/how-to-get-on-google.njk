        <h2>What is Crawling/Crawl Requests for Search Engines?</h2>
        <p>
            Have you ever wondered how Google finds webpages it uses to provide it's users with answers. The answer to that is robots. Robots or 'bots' are programs that are used to scour the internet with the purpose of collecting data/content from websites so Google can provide useful information to their users. In order to get your website crawled you can either wait until Google finds your website which can take weeks if not months, or you can sign up for Google like I mentioned earlier in this article and speed up the process by just a few days. 
        </p>

        <h2>What Is Indexing? - Search Engines</h2>
        <p>
            **Indexing** After Google has found your content through crawling it then has to decided if the information on your website/webpages is good enough to be listed in their search results. This process takes a lot of factors into consideration some of which are pretty well known and others that Google doesn't really let anyone know about. Generally speaking if the page you're trying to get listed in Google's search results are well written, are a decent length, and have some informative and useful content then Google will most likely index it.

        </p>

        <h2>What Is Search Engine Ranking?</h2>

        <p>
            While ranking may not be a step in actually getting your website listed in Google search results it's important that you know about it so that you can progress in your search engine optimization efforts. Ranking is how Google determines what position your page appears in. The more relevant and useful information on a page is the higher it ranks in search results. Keep in mind that their are also a lot of other factors that determine a pages position in the search engine.
