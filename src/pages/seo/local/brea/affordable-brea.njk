        <h1>Affordable Expert Website Design Services in Brea, California</h1>
        <p>Are you looking for an affordable website solution in the Brea, California area?  </p>
        <p>Hello my name is Ruben, I've been working on websites for a few years & I'd like to help you create the website you truly want.
        </p>
        <p>A lot of people make the assumption that you need a ton of money to start a website.  And yes, pouring a lot of money into a website will get you some return on your investment it doesn't have to cost you an arm and a leg when you work with me!
        </p>
        <h2>Why Having A Website Is Important</h2>

        <p>Having a website is an important aspect of owning a business. 
        </p>
        <p>A website not only provides you with tools to manage and market your business but it's also the first impressions potential customers get from you.
        </p>
        <h3>The Cost of Running A Website</h3>
        <p>As a small business owner or someone looking to make a personal website you don't always want to invest a ton of time and money.
        </p>
        <h3>What You Get With Me You Won't Get From A Site Builder</h3>
        <p>Site building tools are awesome! you pay a few bucks a month and you get access to a lot of tools to help you easily build a website. 
        </p>
        <p>While these tools are amazing they do pose a problem for people who are looking to stand out online. Website building tools have a reputation of being limited in their designs.  They tools they offer for building sites eventually make a lot of them look the same.
        </p>
        <p>The difference you get with me compared to site building tools like Wix or WordPress is that you get a one of a kind website design that you nobody else will have.
