It's pretty well documented that good design establishes trust with it's users so in order for you to get as much as you can from your website it's imperative that at some point you invest a bit of money and time into it's appearance.

                    <h3>How You Can Benefit From A Website</h3>
                    <p>One thing I like to stress is that you don't need to own a store or to even have a business to get something out of a website, ordinary people look you and I can benefit a lot too from investing in in one. One of the ways a website can help you is through networking. Whether you're goals are 'business orientated' or you're working on a personal passion, highlighting you're skills, goals, and knowledge on a website can give you access to doors that might have not been available otherwise. </p>

                    <p>Take this example for instance. When I first began learning about these things I didn't really understand what I was getting into. The only thing I knew was that I enjoyed being able to solve problems using computers and their was some decent money in doing so. The more I experimented with web design the more I began to realize how effective it could be. One of the first websites I made landed me a few high end clients and a couple of really good job opportunities. The fact that people came searching for me offering me a different path amazed me!

                <h2>Content Creation</h2>
                <p>Having sufficient and helpful content on your website is vital for its success. Without any content your website is essentially just pictures and graphics. In order for you to get customers and to appear in more search engine results its important that you take the time to write about the things you do and how you can help.

                <h3>Why Content Is Important</h3>
                <p>Words are important they have a lot of meaning and help us categories things. Words are also how the internet works. Think about it, when you want to know more about a topic the first thing you do is type the words or phrases associated with that topic into a search bar in order to learn more. The same principals apply with your business, the more information you have about a location the more people will find you. </p>
