    <h2>What Is The Cost of Running A Website?</h2>
    <p>
        You see their are a lot of fees and commitment to developing a website.  To start off you need a domain name that can cost you anywhere from $10 a year all the way up to $100' if not $1,000's. Then you have server space which can cost you anywhere from $5 to $20 a month just to rent out. Just to get the requirements for a website you're looking at a minimum of $100 a year in the essential.  Then finally you have to hire someone to make all the pages and content and that's where you really end up having to pay an arm and a leg.

        Theirs no way to get a more customized website then to learn how to code.  While site builders offer a decent amount of tools to help you design your website they do have their limitations in what they can do.

        Site builder design tools where made with ease of use and convince in mind.  While this does help the general user of these site builders it also limits them to what they can do.
