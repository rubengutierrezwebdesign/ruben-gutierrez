<div class="post">

    <p>
        Lately I've been using AI to create images so that I can promote my website on social media.
    </p>

    <p>
        Images tend to get more engagment than words alone
    </p>

    <h2>Using Dall-E</h2>

    <p>
        Theirs a lot of AI options out there to generate images but I'm keeping it basic and using Dall-E which gives you the option of creating up to 15 free images in a 24 hour peroid which is more than enough to regularly post.
        
        With some simple request to Dall-E  you can generate images that are completing free to you. Dall-E Gives you access to 15 free images a day.
