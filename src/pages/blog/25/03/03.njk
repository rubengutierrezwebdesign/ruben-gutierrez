<p>
    Hello my name is Ruben Gutierrez and I've been working on computers for a while now. Throughout the last 20 years I've probably owned about 50 or so computers ranging from $1500 laptops to free desktops I've received from clients and friends. Owning and repairing countless computers has helped me learn what to look for and understanding the trade offs between different brands, price ranges, and features. 
</p>

<p>Earlier this year I set out to buy a new work computer for as cheap as I could get it and this is how it turned out.</p>

<h2>Looking For A Similar Computer To The One I Already Have</h2>
<p>
    My main computer for a while now has been a laptop I purchased from a major retailer for $600 brand new. This laptop has a very capable 6 core CPU (Ryzen 5500U) that idles at 2.1GHz with boosted speeds of 4Ghz, basically it can handle almost anything I've been able to throw at it. 
    
    
    Some of the strain I've been able to put on this laptop without seeing any sort of lag  As a developer my daily workflow involves having multiple tabs open on different instances of Google Chrome while simultaneously switching between half a dozen different design tools.  
</p>

<h2>Why I Want This computer. and What I Was Looking For In My New PC</h2>
<p>
    While it may sound absurd now that I think about it I really wanted a computer that could match my laptop for a fraction of the price. The reasons for buying this new computer is to improve my workflow by taking advantage of the large 28 inch monitor and desk I've been piecing together.

<p>
   Performance & Speed -
</p>

<p>
    Affordability. Max budget of $50 - $80 dollars.
</p>

<p>
    A computer capable of handling heavy multitasking without performance issues (lag, freeze, etc.).  Some of the software I use when I'm working are programs like VSCode, Inkscape, GIMP, Figma etc. basically a lot of programs for making websites and web content. These programs don't require a lot of RAM & CPU to run individually but when their used in a work environment where you're constantly switching from window to window it can create issues especially on computers with lower end chip sets.
</p>

<h2>Researching The Computer</h2>
<p>
    After doing research for a few days I came to a few conclusions. 
</p>

<p>
    I didn't want a laptop due to the fact that most laptop sold in my budgets price range usually contain low end chip sets that are designed for mostly internet surfing and emails.
</p>

<p>
    Their are hardly any Good computers for this price range that can do what I need to do, which is website development.
</p>

<h2>Purchasing The Lenovo ThinkCentre M715Q</h2>
<p>
    After countless hours of typing in variations of the phrase "cheapest mini pc" into Google and comparing tens of dozens of specification and models I can confidently say that I ended up purchasing the The Lenovo ThinkCentre M715Q. This Computer has a Ryzen 5 2400GE CPU chip set and 8G of RAM.
