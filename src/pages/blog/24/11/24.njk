<p>
    Today I made the decisions of moving over my website from Jekyll to 11ty.
</p>
<p>
    I've been using Jekyll for almost 5 years and it's the first static site generator I learned how to use. Jekyll really helped me learn a lot about website design. Jekyll took me from being a website designer that relied on one page HTML templates and WordPress themes to someone who's a little more familiar with the intricacies of building out larger web projects.

<p> 
    While I didn't really plan to make the move I had no option when Jekyll started taking longer and longer to generate my website. I finally gave up when my computer froze for almost an entire minature. At first I thought it was my computer or a hardware issue because I was using a slightly older laptop, but after running some tests on my high performcances pc I realized it wasn't a problem with my computer at all It was the software I was using. Now their nothing wrong with Jekyll but after doiong some research I learned that I was using a software with 
</p>
<p> 
    After a while of doing some research on static site generators and the languages they're built with I started to realized that I had been using a software that wasn't really meant for what I was trying to make it do.

    Up until recently most of the things I had been making with jekyll where smaller and didn't really have a ton of pages or extra code.  These types of projects work really well with Jekyll because the language Jekyll is built on Ruby while very reliable is not as fast as some of the new options availibel today
    
    The things is now that I've gotten a little more seiours about website development I've been making more content.

<h2>Some Of Jekyll's Limitation</h2>
<p>
    up until recently I only ever really used Jekyll for smaller websites and seo projects. Now that I'm building larger websites it's been taking longer and longer to compile my website.
</p>

<h3>Looking For Alternatives</h3>
<p>
    I started to look for alternatives and the more I looked the more overwhelmed I got about choosing one. In the back of my mind all I wanted was a static site generator that generated as quick as possible but the more I thought about it the more I was able to narrow down some of the.

<h3>Why I Chose 11ty</h3>
<p>
    While it has been a bit of a headache adapting to this new static site generator it has gone relatively well and I'm quite surprised by the speed and features.
</p>
<p>I chose 11ty for a few reasons but the main one is for it's speed.</p>
<p>
    From what I've read online it seems that Jekyll is built using older technology. Compare that to 11ty that's built with JavaScript and builds website almost instantaneously.
