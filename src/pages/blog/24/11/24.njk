        Today I made the decisions of moving my website over from Jekyll to 11ty. The reasons I finally decided to switch over to a more modern static site generate started because I ran into a situation that I had never encountered while using Jekyll.

    <h2>Learning Jekyll Forced Me To Become A Better Website Developer</h2>
    <p>
        I've been using Jekyll for a while now and learning it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Jekyll was the first static site generator I learned how to use mainly because I wanted to host my website for free on Github. I'll always appreciate Jekyll because through the process of learning this software I also learned all the little details that requires creating and deploying a website from the bottom up Before learning Jekyll I relied on various types of templating software like WordPress themes to build out my web projects, while these technologies are great they don't offer the level of customization that I was looking for. 

    <h3>What Happened That Made Me Switch</h3>
    <p> 
        I didn't really plan on learning how to use a new static site generator but the longer my Jekyll site was taking to load after making some edits the more I began to consider finding alternative options. I finally decided to make the move when my laptop froze for almost an entire minute. At first I thought it was my hardware because the laptop I was using at that moment was a little older, but after running some tests on my higher performing PC's a little later I realized it wasn't a problem with my laptop at all It was the software I was using and what I was expecting from it. 
        Up until now I had been using Jekyll for smaller websites that focused more on design or very text heavy SEO projects which is why I never ran into performance issues. Now that I'm creating larger projects with more code and assets I've quickly hit it's limitations.

    <h3>Jekyll Is For Smaller Website Projects</h3>
    <p class="mb-100">     
        Through some research I learned that longer build times are a very common problem when it comes to Jekyll projects especially when they contain a lot of content. I even read about a person who's site had around 100 pages and their build time was about a half an hour. Theirs a lot of well informed opinions in the web design forums expressing that the reason Jekyll can be problematic is because Ruby on Rails, the language used to write Jekyll, is outdated while others say file configuration can also play a significantly role in increasing build time. I couldn't really tell you what makes Jekyll act up but what I can tell you is that Jekyll is a reliable tool that works wonders.

    <h2>Choosing A New Static Site Generator</h2>
    <p>
        My first move was to Google a list of the most popular static site generators to try and compare some of the differences. Onces I became a little more familiar with them I was able to dig a bit deeper and find charts comparing build times among some of the most popular static site generators which helped me narrow my selections down. After some further consideration I was able to finally make a decisions. Theirs are countless static site generator out their to choose from but I after looking into further I've decided that the best option for me is 11ty.

    <h3>Why I Chose 11ty As My New Static Site Generator</h3>
    <p>
        The main reason I picked 11ty is because of the build time. the way to go for me. Other than the speed the other determingin factors where file types and ease.

    <h3>Some of the things I struggled with</h3>
    <p>
        One of the reasons I never considered learning another static site generators was because I thought It was going to take me a long time to learn. I was right but after fiddling around
