        <h2 class="h3">How I Got Started With Technology</h2>

        <p>
            My interest with technology started when I received my first computer for Christmas when I was around ten years old. The first computer I ever received was the heaviest HP desktop that the local Best Buy had to offer. When I wasn't taking the whole thing apart to clear the dust out I was researching ways to make it run as smooth as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            As IT work began to decline I turned my attention towards website development and design. Today my focus is on helping people improve their online presence through web technology. Below are some of the skills and technologies I've learned in the past few years.

        <h2>Technologies I'm Familiar With</h2>
        <p>
            For me technology is a constantly changing field that requires you to quickly learn new skills to adapt and overcome different obstacle. With that said I also think it's important to let people know some of the exact tools you're familiar with in order to help them gauge you're understanding and whether you can help them.

            <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            The foundation of the internet but really HTML has given me the ability to turn my simple ideas into something tangible. HTML allows me to present my creativity in ways that social media and other platforms just can't match. It still baffles me to think that this seemingly simple markup language has the capacity to provide soo much assistance in the forms of tools and information for anyone throughout the world.
        </p>

        <h3>Static Site Generators</h3>
        <p>
            Not exactly a specific technology but overall static site generator like jekyll and 11ty have not only made it easier for me to maintain larger and more complex projects but it's also helped me learn the ins and outs of front end design. t easier to maintain my projects at scale. These have brought about an effiecienty and order into my life almost absolutely free. Tools like Jekyll and 11ty </p>

        <h3>WordPress</h3>
        <p>One of these most valuable skills I've learned as a freelance website developer has been WordPress. With 40 percent of the website online being ran on WordPress it goes without saying that WordPress is a corner stone of the internet. Learning that has made it possible for me to find employment </p>
