        <h2 class="h3">How I Got Started Working With Computers & Website</h2>

        <p>
            My interest with technology started when I received my first computer for Christmas when I was around ten years old. After taking my new computer apart and putting it back together a dozen times I learned enough about them to start doing IT work for my friends and family. After computer repair I moved on to coding and now I focus on website development and online marketing.

            <h2 class="h3">Technologies I'm Familiar With</h2>
            <p>
                For me technology is a constantly changing field that requires you to quickly learn new skills to adapt and overcome different obstacle. With that said I also think it's important to let people know some of the exact tools you're familiar with in order to help them gauge you're understanding and whether you can help them.

            <h3 class="h4">HTML</h3>
            <p>
                The foundation of the internet but really HTML has given me the ability to turn my simple ideas into something tangible. HTML allows me to present my creativity in ways that social media and other platforms just can't match. It still baffles me to think that this seemingly simple markup language has the capacity to provide soo much assistance in the forms of tools and information for anyone throughout the world.
