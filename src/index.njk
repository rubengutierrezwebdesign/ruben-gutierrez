            <h1>Rubén Gutierrez</h1>
            <p>
                Hello, my name is Rubén Gutierrez and I am a Website Developer from La Habra, California. I've been building website for a while now and I am profoundly passionate about using technology to help others do what they really want to do. My interest with technology started when I received my first computer for Christmas when I was around ten years old. After taking my new computer apart and putting it back together a dozen times I learned enough about them to start doing IT work for my friends and family. After computer repair I moved on to coding and now I focus on website development and online marketing.

            <h2 class="h3">Technologies I'm Familiar With</h2>
            <p>
                For me technology is a constantly changing field that requires you to quickly learn new skills to adapt and overcome different obstacle. With that said I also think it's important to let people know some of the exact tools you're familiar with in order to help them gauge you're understanding and whether you can help them.

                <h3 class="h4">HTML</h3>
                <p>
                    HTML gives me the ability to present my ideas in ways that social media just can't and turn my simple ideas into something tangible.

                <p>
                    Static site generators like Jekyll & 11ty have taught me the nuances of web design and made it possible for me to create and maintain larger web projects.
