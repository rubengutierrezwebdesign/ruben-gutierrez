        <h2>Made My Web Pricing Tool Functional</h2>
        <p>
            On Monday I started writing the code for a pricing tool I'd been thinking about. The JavaScript I put together adds up all the selected user inputs and outputs a total on submission. The goal with this tool is to give people interested in starting a website an estimate of how much their website is going to cost. Now that I'm finished working on the logic , I'll be focusing on trying to make this tool more engaging by adding vector icons and animations.

        <h2>Google Crawls & Indexes Content I Wrote A Year Ago </h2>
        
        <p>
            Learning a new technology can be time-consuming but very necessary if you want to make progress. With a little I'm slowly becoming more familiar with 11ty and I'm not getting an error every 5 seconds, I've started to move over a bunch of content I had written from my previous website.  was making the adjustments to all the code so that the content on the pages could have a basic layout and not break the entire website. While starting this process, I was also trying to learn how to implement a sitemp for 11ty. Somewhere between adding the content and implementing the sitemap, Google went ahead and crawled and indexed a bunch of those new pages I had added, a lot of which were not exactly ready to be published. Probably not a big deal, and if I do get those "canonical" error notifications from Search Console, I'll handle them accordingly.
        </p>

        <p>
            Something positive about this situation was that I got a bunch of data from Google Search Console. This is probably not the best way to get this type of informaiton but it helps knowing which exact keywords are actually getting searched for.

        <h2>Learning How To Use The Foreground Tool in GIMP</h2>
        <p>
            One of the more exciting things I did this week is learn how to use the foreground tool in GIMP. I already know how to use the free select tool to remove objects from images but the foreground tools offers an unmatched attention to detail. The reasons I spent a couple hours learning how to use this instead of continuing to use the free select tool is because I've been trying to step my website design skills up and I figured learning how to better cut objects out of images is going to do just that. 
        </p>

        <h3>What Sets The Foreground Tool Apart When Cutting Out Hair</h3>
        <p>Cutting out objects from images with straight lines can be a bit time consuming but fairly simple process that delivers great results. Where the foreground tool shines that the free select tools lacks in is fine details. Things like hair in images is always hard to isolate and crop around because of how frizzy and fine hair naturally  is.  I don't know if you know this but people seeing other people in images creates a better sense of trust in the visitor, shocking I now.</p></p>
