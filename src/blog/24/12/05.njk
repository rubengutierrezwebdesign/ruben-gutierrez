    <p>This is a new website design I've been working on. I'll make sure to add it to my <a href="/figma-templates/">figma template</a> collection.</p>
    <h2>What I'm Going To Be Doing</h2>
<p>I still have to do a few things like. Fix the spacing between the elements and cut out an image of a dentist. </p>
