    <h1>Fullerton, California</h1>
    <p>Fullerton is a located in the the northern region of Orange County in The State of California.</p>
    <h2>How Did Fullerton Get It's Name?</h2>
    
    <p>
        The city of Fullerton was named by brothers George and Edward Amerige, who where grain merchants from Massachusets. Fullerton was named after the president of the Pacific Land and Improvement Company, George Fullerton. The Pacific Land and Improvement Company was a part of a much larger company, Central Pacific Railroad, which was tasked by the government with building out a transcontinental railroad that sought to connect people on both the east and west side of the country. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The naming of the city begins when both brothers leave their suburb right outside of Boston, Massachusets in the late 1800's. After finally visiting California, becoming obsessed with the potential in the area, and selling their 10 acre orange ranch they had initially purchased in the Sierra Madre, the brothers began to shift their focus on establishing a city by purchasing around 500 acres of land from various owners in the area that would become The City of Fullerton. Where one of the brothers, Edward, drove a steak through a mustard field is now the corner of Harbor Boulevard and Commonwealth Avenue.
    </p>

    <h2>Who Where The Earliest People To Inhabit The Fullerton Area?</h2>
    <p>
        Fullerton earliest inhabits are known as the Tongva. The "Tongva" which means "people of the earth" are a group of Native American people who have been living in the area that is now Southern California for the last few thousand years.

        Some of the account of the portola expedition have the Spanish Explorers sleeping in what
        is now hill crest park before heading off up to harbor blvd.
