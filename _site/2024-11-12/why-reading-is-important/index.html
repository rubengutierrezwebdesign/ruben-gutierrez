        Like most kids I never really enjoyed reading when I was younger. To me it was just another task that got in the way of me smashing things together & making explosion noises.
    </p>

    <p>
        A lot of the time when I was expected to be reading I would just scan the pages with my finger to give whoever was standing over me idea that I was paying attentiopn.

        Now a days we take our ability to consume productive and useful content whenever we want gets taken for granted and how could you not with so much distracting programs so readily available.

    <h2>Does Anyone Even Read Anymore</h2>
    <p>
        One of the reasons I really enjoy reading is because it helps lead you're mind on a new path. When you read it's quite easy to get distracted and that one of the main reasons I enjoy doing it so much. down a lot of the voices in your head that can keep you idle.
    </p>

    <p>
        Reading has helped me learn so many skills I would have not otherwise had. It's helped me gain new perspectives and allowed me to empathies with people who'm I might have just walked by.

        Whenever you find yourself in a sea of contratdictions just take a deep breathe and try to focus on something you like. Once you have something in mind try and ask some questions about that subject. If you find your.
