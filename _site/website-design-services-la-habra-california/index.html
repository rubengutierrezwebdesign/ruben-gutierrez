        <h3>My Goals As A Website Designer</h3>
        <p>
            When I began my journey to become a website designer all I really wanted to do was to make some money using my interest for technology. Now that I've gotten a bit older I've come to understand a little more about the world and how I want to make it better. One thing I've noticed is that a lot of people around me in the La Habra, California area don't really understand the benefits of some of the these modern communication tools.
        </p>
    </div>
</div>

<p>Take this example for instance. When I first began learning about the internet, communication ,and websites I didn't really understand what I was getting into. The only thing I knew was that I enjoyed being able to solve problems using computers and that their was some decent money in doing so. The more I progressed as a web developer the more I began to realize how effective websites can be. One of the first websites I made landed me a few high end clients and a couple of really good job opportunities. The fact that people came searching for me offering me a different path amazed me!
</p>
<p>Another things to keep in mind is that you don't need a store or to even have a business to benefit from a website. Anybody looking to make progress in their careers and goals should use a website to get ahead.
</p>
<p>Investing a bit of time and money into a website can have profound effects on a persons life.  Websites allow for people from all over the world and all walks of life to get to know you. They can open a door that you might have never known about otherwise, the opportunities are endless!.
