<p>Are you looking for an Affordable Website Designer in the Fullerton, California area?
</p>
<p>Finding someone who can build and manage your website for a low cost doesn't even seem plausible. Generally speaking you have to pay someone or an agency thousands of dollars to get a premium looking website along with friendly customer service. While that's generally true I'm here to tell is is that is not the case when you work with me. Hello, my name is Ruben! I've been building website and optimizing them for the search engine for a few years and I'd like to help you.</p>

<h2>What You Get With Me That You Won't Get From An Agency or Another Low Cost Web Designer in The Fullerton, California Area</h2>
<p>Websites and the technology surrounding them can be a bit confusing and hard to wrap your head around. For this reasons one of my biggest focuses as a website designer is to make sure that the people I work with understand how these modern communication technologies work so that they can progress in their goals. When you work with me you'll get a custom website solution along with attentive services that answer any question or concern you have.
</p>
<h2>Website Building Tools Make Website They Won't Get You Traffic Or Teach You How</h2>
<p>Wondering why you should work with me when you can build your site using website building tools. Below I've listed a few of the benefits you'll get if you decide to collaborate with me. You'll also find some information about the pros and cons about these tools.
</p>
<h2>Counseling, Guidance</h2> 
<p>Website building tools like Wix and WordPress are great at creating decent looking websites. They provide intuitive tools that can help you add functionality to your website in a short amount of time. While these services can seem like a quick solutions their are some things they don't mention. One of my biggest problems with these type of tools is the idea they give the people they advertise to. They make it seem like having the website itself will be enough to start generating traffic and selling your products. A lot of the time what's not mentioned is the other tasks you have to do to actually get people to your website. To have a successful you need more than just a visually pleasing website you also need to understand the fundamentals of search engines and online marketing to get visitors. One of the benefits you'll receive working with me is just that, I'll not only help you optimize and market your website but I'll also make sure you understand the basic ideas so that you can actually see some return on your investment.
</p>
<h2>Universal Designs vs Custom Design</h2>
<p>As a website designer/developer I've used many different tools to make website including website builders. One of the major downside to a lot of these drag and drop tools is the design. While their are a decent amount of themes you can choose from you're pretty much stuck with the options made available to you by the developers. What ends up happening because of these limitations is a lot of website online end up looking the same. This problem may not be as important to you when you're starting off but it can definitely hinder your progress as you grow. I'll make sure your website not only looks great but that it compliments your business and is a one of a kind. 
</p>
<p>**Price** You work hard for your money so don't let it go to waste. Website building tools and services can cost you around $20 - $30 a month. When you do the math you'll end up spending close to $400 a year just to have access to the their services so that you can operate your website. Other factors you'll have to include is the time you'll have to spend familiarizing yourself with the website building software or the designer you'll have to pay to get it to look exactly how you want it too. The service I provide will cost you the same if not a little less but in return you'll get a ton of benefits that go beyond just the access to the services. You'll also get the benefit of having a beautifully crafted website with the peace of mind that comes with never having to deal with all the nuances and headaches that come with building one yourself.
