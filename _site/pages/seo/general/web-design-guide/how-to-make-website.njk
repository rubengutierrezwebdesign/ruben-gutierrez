    <h1 class="mb-50">How To Make A Website</h1>

    <p class="">
        Hello, my name is Ruben Gutierrez and I'm a Website Developer and today I'm going to be showing you how to make a website.
    </p>


    <h2>Over complicating Website Development</h2>

    <p>
        I feel like a lot of <b>"how to make a website"</b> tutorials are very confusing with a ton of extra details that take away from understanding the fundamentals of making a website.
    </p>

    <h2>Website Are Just A Group Of Files</h2>

    <p>
        So to start off, the first thing you need to understand is that websites are just a group of files that sit inside a folder hosted on a server.
    </p>

    <h2>What Types of Files Make Up A Website</h2>

    <p>
        Website development can get complicated, but to make a basic website all you really need are these main types of files.<b>HTML, CSS, & Javascript.</b> These three types of files give your webpage structure, design, and logic. Read more below.
    </p>

    <strong>HTML</strong>
    <p>Defines elements and gives structure to the website</p>
    <p>The HTML File Extension Looks like this</p>
    <p>index.html</p>

    <strong>CSS</strong>
    <p>Gives A Webpage it's visual elements, provides.</p>
    <p>The HTML File Extension Looks like this</p>
    <p>application.html</p>

    <strong>Javascript</strong>
    <p>Provides Logic, Animation.</p>
    <p>The HTML File Extension Looks like this</p>
    <p>javascript.html</p>

    <h2>What You'll Need To Make A Website</h2>

    <p>
        You don't need anything fancy to make a basic website, in fact you can even use a standard text editor but I wouldn't recommend it.
    </p>

    <p>
        What I would recommend is that you use a tool like  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VsCode</a> which is like a text editor but it provides a lot of extra tools that visually highlight your code and make it significantly easier to create web pages. Plus it's free.
    </p>

    <div class="">
        <p>
            You don't need anything fancy to put together a bare bones website. You can even use the text editor that comes stock with your operating system, but if you do want something that will make  your life a little easier you can download  <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">VsCode</a>VsCode or Visual Studio Code is one of the more cutting edge text editors out their right now and it's absolutely free. VsCode does very practical things like Highlihgt code and give you the option to install plugins that make coding significanlty easier.

            <h2>Before We Begin To Write Any Code</h2>
            <p>
                The first thing you need to understand about websites is that website are basically just a group of certain types of files. Websites and programming in general can be very off putting to people becasue</p>

            <h2>Step 1: Create A Folder</h2>
            <p> Now that you undertand that we can move on to the  you're going to do is create a folder so that you can store all you're files, name it whatever you like. To create a folder you need to right click on your scroll down to "New" and click itI suggest right clicking on your desktop and heading down t up the folder in your text editor.</p>

            <h2>Step 2: Creating An HTML File</h2>
            <p class="mb-25">
                The main types of files you'll be using when you're developing website are mark up files. Mark up files are coding language used to give render and give structure to information and media.
