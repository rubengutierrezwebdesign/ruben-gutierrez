    <h1 class="mb-50">How To Make The Most Basic Website</h1>

    <p class="">
        Hello, my name is Ruben Gutierrez and I'm a Website Developer and today I'm going to be showing you how to make the most basic website/webpage.
    </p>

    <h2>Overcomplicating Website Development</h2>

    <p>
        To me, a lot of <b>"how to make a website"</b> tutorials are very confusing with a ton of extra details that take away from understanding the fundamentals of website design.
    </p>

    <p>
        To start off, the first thing you need to understand is that websites are just a group of files that sit inside a folder hosted on a server.
    </p>

    <p>
        Website development can get complicated with a lot of different file types, but to make a basic website all you really need are these three main types of files <b>HTML, CSS, & Javascript.</b> These files provide your website with basic structure, design, and logic.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Requirements: </strong>You don't need anything fancy to make a webpage, you can even use your standard text editor but I would not recommend it. What I would suggest is using a tool like <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Studio Code</a> which provides you with a ton of extra features like code highlighting to make building your website much easier.</p>

            <h2>Basic Layout</h2>
            <p class="mb-25">
                The main types of files you'll be using when you're developing website are mark up files. Mark up files are coding language used to give render and give structure to information and media.

            <pre>   
                <code class="language-html">
   

    &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
    &lt;html lang="en"&gt;
    &lt;head&gt;

        // Support for characters and symbols
        &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt;
        // Scaling, ensuring proper rendering across different screen sizes. 
        &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"&gt;
        // Your Pages Title
        &lt;title>Document&lt;/title&gt;
        
    &lt;/head&gt;
    &lt;body&gt;
        
    &lt;/body&gt;
    &lt;/html&gt;
