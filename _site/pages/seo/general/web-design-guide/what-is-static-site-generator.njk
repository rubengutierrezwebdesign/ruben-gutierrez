    <h1>What Is A Static Site Generator?</h1>
    <p class="mw-500">
        Static site generators (SSGs) are a type of software that use text input files (such as Markdown, JSON) to compile and generate static websites and pages. In contrast with dynamic websites, static pages do not change. This simplifies the requirements for the backend and allows the site to be distributed via content delivery networks (CDN)s. The simple design also makes it harder for attackers to modify the website due to the smaller attack surface of these relatively simple backends. Some of the most popular static site generators are Jekyll, Hugo, Eleventy, Gatsby, and Next.js,[2][3] SSGs are typically for rarely-changing, informative content, such as product pages, news articles, software documentation, and blogs.z
