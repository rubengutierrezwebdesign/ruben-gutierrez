    <h2>How Did Fullerton Get It's Name?</h2>
    
    <p>
        The city of Fullerton was named by brothers George and Edward Amerige, who where grain merchants from Massachusets. Fullerton was named after the president of the Pacific Land and Improvement Company, George Fullerton. The Pacific Land and Improvement Company was a part of a much larger company, Central Pacific Railroad, which was tasked by the government with building out a transcontinental railroad that sought to connect people on both the east and west side of the country.

    <p>
        The naming of the city begins when both brothers leave their suburb right outside of Boston, Massachusets in the late 1800's. After finally visiting California, becoming obsessed with the potential in the area, and selling their 10 acre orange ranch they had initially purchased in the Sierra Madre, the brothers began to shift their focus on establishing a city by purchasing around 500 acres of land from various owners in the area that would become The City of Fullerton. Where one of the brothers, Edward, drove a steak through a mustard field is now the corner of Harbor Boulevard and Commonwealth Avenue.
