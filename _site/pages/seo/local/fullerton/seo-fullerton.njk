        <p>Trying to understand how search engines like Google work can seem a bit complicated, but just like anything else when you break down the process step by step it becomes a lot easier to wrap your head around.
        </p>
        <p>The way search engines produce relevant and helpful information about topics you're interested in begins the moment you type your question into the search bar and press enter. From there Google pulls webpages from it's database containing similar keywords and phrases based on what you typed. If you're wondering how Google has these webpages in its database it's through a process known as "crawling, discovery, and indexing". If you'd like to know more about how it works read the section below. Once Google has collected all the webpages containing those keywords it determines which ones are the most useful based on known and unknown variables. After determining which webpages are best suited to answer your question Google creates a ranked list of links to those webpages which is what you end up seeing. 
        </p>
        <h2>How To Get Your Website in Google Search Results</h2>
        <p>Getting your website and webpages listed in Google Search Results is fairly simple. All you really need to do is create a decent amount of content and submit it in the Search Console. If you do these two things you can get your website listed in a few days. If you'd like to know more about the process I wrote a little bit about it here "How to get Your Website Listed in Google". This guide will elaborate the process further and can help you start taking action today!
