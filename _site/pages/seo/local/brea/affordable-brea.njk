    <p>Are you looking for an affordable website solution in the Brea, California area?Hello my name is Ruben Gutierrez, I've been working on websites for a few years & I'd like to help you create the website you truly want.</p>

    <h2>Why Having A Website Is Important</h2>

    <p>Having a website is an important aspect of owning a business. A website not only provides you with tools to manage and market your business but it's also the first impressions potential customers get from you.
    </p>
    <p>
    </p>
    <h3>The Cost of Running A Website</h3>
    <p>As a small business owner or someone looking to make a personal website you don't always want to invest a ton of time and money.
    </p>
    <h3>What You Get With Me You Won't Get From A Site Builder</h3>
    <p>Site building tools are awesome! you pay a few bucks a month and you get access to a lot of tools to help you easily build a website. 
    </p>
    <p>While these tools are amazing they do pose a problem for people who are looking to stand out online. Website building tools have a reputation of being limited in their designs.  They tools they offer for building sites eventually make a lot of them look the same.
    </p>
    <p>The difference you get with me compared to site building tools like Wix or WordPress is that you get a one of a kind website design that you nobody else will have.
