        <p>
            Hello, my name is Ruben Gutierrez and I am a Website Developer from La Habra, California. I've been building website for a few years and I am profoundly passionate about website technology and helping others do what they really want to do.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I'm not helping someone out or planning my next project I'm usually working on creating website design resources that I make available for free on my website.

    <h2>How I Got Started With Technology</h2>

    <p>
        My interest with technology started when I received my first computer for Christmas when I was around ten years old. The first computer I ever received was the heaviest HP desktop that the local Best Buy had to offer. When I wasn't taking the whole thing apart to clear all the dust out I was looking up videos and articles in order to make it run as smooth as possible.

        It was at this time in the early 2000's the internet really began to take off, advancements in technology and the global economy made it possible for the average person like myself to own a personal computer. While mostly a good time this early era of the modern internet was plagued with a lot security problems that created a lot computer repair shops and made life for most PC owners a nightmare.

        Despite all the downsides everyone I knew was both excited and invested in the web and very quickly I found myself in a situation where I had learned a lot of important and lucrative adult skills at a very young age in a time where the repair work seemed endless.  This became evident to me when the people I only ever briefly met through my parents or my family began to hand me big bills for giving their once doomed computer a new life.

    <h3>Technologies I'm familiar With</h3>

    <p>
        As much as I believe that technology is a field that's constantly changing field and requires you to quickly learn new things to overcome different obstacle, I also think it's important to let people know some of the tools I've worked with and how I've used them.
    </p>

    <p><strong>HTML </strong> has given me the ability to turn my simple ideas into something tangible. HTML allows me to present my creativity in ways that social media and other platforms just can't. It still baffles me to think that this seemingly simple markup language has the capacity to provide soo much assistance in the forms of tools and information for anyone throughout the world.</p>

    <p><strong>Static Site Generators </strong> have made it easier to maintain my projects at scale. These have brought about an effiecienty and order into my life almost absolutely free. Tools like Jekyll and 11ty </p>

    <p><strong>WordPress </strong>One of these most valuable skills I've learned as a freelance website developer has been WordPress. With 40 percent of the website online being ran on WordPress it goes without saying that WordPress is a corner stone of the internet. ov</p>
