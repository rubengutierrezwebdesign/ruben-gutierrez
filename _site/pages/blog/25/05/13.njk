        Lately I've been using AI to create images so that I can promote my website on social media.

    <p>
        Images tend to get more engagement than words alone

        Part of my goals include teaching more hispanic/latinos how to code because they are a very underrepresented group in the tech so I use a lot of.

    <h2>Using Dall-E</h2>

    <p>
        Theirs a lot of AI options out there to generate images but I'm keeping it basic and using Dall-E which gives you the option of creating up to 15 free images in a 24 hour period which is more than enough to regularly post.
        
        With some simple request to Dall-E  you can generate images that are completing free to you.
