<p>
    Hello my name is Ruben Gutierrez and I've been working on computers since I was ten years old. All together I've probably owned close to a fifty or so computers throughout the last 20 years ranging from $1500 laptops to free desktops I've recieved from clients and friends. I've also spent quite a bit of my time repairing hundreds if not more so It's fair to say I've gotten really good at spotting the pros and cons between different brands, price ranges, and features. earlier this year I set out to buy a new work computer.  
    
    My main goal was to get something for the lowest price I could get without sacrificing things like performance and speed.

<h2>What I Was Looking For In My New Computer</h2>
<p>I didn't really have a ton of requirements for my new computer. </p>

<p>
    Affordability. Max budget of $50 - $80 dollars.

<p>
    A computer capable of handling heavy multitasking without performance issues (lag, freeze, etc.).  Some of the software I use when I'm working are programs like VSCode, Inkscape, GIMP, Figma etc. basically a lot of programs for making websites and web content. These programs don't require a lot of RAM & CPU to run individually but when their used in a work environment where you're constantly switching from window to window it can create issues especially on computers with lower end chip sets.

<h2>Researching The Computer</h2>
<p>
    After doing research for a few days I came to a few conclusions. 
</p>

<p>
    I didn't want a laptop due to the fact that most laptop sold in my budgets price range usually contain low end chip sets that are designed for mostly internet surfing and emails.
</p>

<p>
    Their are hardly any Good computers for this price range that can do what I need to do, which is website development.

<h2>Purchasing The Lenovo ThinkCentre M715Q</h2>
<p>
    After countless hours of typing in variations of "cheapest mini pc" into Google and comparing tens of dozens of CPU's I can confidently say that I ended up purchasing the The Lenovo ThinkCentre M715Q. This Computer has a Ryzen 5 2400GE CPU chip set and 8 Gigs of RAM. This may not sound like much to people. and let me tell you this computer works almost as good as my $600 laptop.
