    Hello, my name is Ruben Gutierrez, earilier this year I set out to buy a new work computer for the lowest price I could get without sacraficing performance and speed. Let me just add that all together I've probably owned about a hundred computers ranging from $1500 laptops to to free desktops and I've repaired hundreds more so It's fair to say I've gotten really good at spotting the pros and cons between diffrent brands, price ranges, and features.

<h2>What I Was Looking For In My New Computer</h2>
<p>I didn't really have a ton of requiremnts for my new computer. </p>

    Affordablitity. Max budget of $50 - $80 dollars.

    A computer capable of handling heavy multitasking without performence issues (lag, freeze, etc.).  Some of the software I use when I'm working are programs like VSCode, Inkscape, GIMP, Figma etc. basically a lot of programs for making websites and web content. These programs don't require a lot of RAM & CPU to run individually but when their used in a work envioremnet where you're constantly switcthing from window to window it can create issues especially on computers with lower end chip sets.

    Their are hardly any Good computers for this price range that can do what I need to do, which is website development.

<h2>Purchasing The Lenovo 8320 WorkCenter Ryzen 3 2400GE</h2>
<p>
    After countless hours of typing in variations of "cheapest mini pc" into Google and comparing tens of dozens of CPU's I can confidently say that I ended up purchasing the Lenovo Work Center Mini PC. This Computer has a Ryzen 3 2400GE CPU chip set and 8 Gigs of RAM. This may not sound like much to people. and let me tell you this computer works almost as good as my $600 laptop.
