<h2>What Is The Cost of Running A Website?</h2>
<p>
    The cost of running a website can vary depending on a few variables. heir are a lot of fees and commitment to developing a website.  To start off you need a domain name that can cost you anywhere from $10 a year all the way up to $100' if not $1,000's. Then you have server space which can cost you anywhere from $5 to $20 a month just to rent out. Just to get the requirements for a website you're looking at a minimum of $100 a year in the essential.  Then finally you have to hire someone to make all the pages and content and that's where you really end up having to pay an arm and a leg.
