    <h2>What is this?</h2>
    <p class="mb-50">This is a landing page design I made in Figma. I don't rmember exactly why I made this design so red but I do remember that at some point I was getting tired of making black text white background designs so I thought a little outside the box with this one.</p>


    <h3>My Goal</h3>
    <p>My goal with this website and templates like this is to distribute free design resources.</p>
    <p class="mb-50">Making these design resources is free though. </p>
