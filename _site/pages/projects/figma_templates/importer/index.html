        <h2>About This Template</h2>
        <p>
            This is a mobile website design for a car importing/importer business. Kei cars are the smallest category of vehicles sold in Japan. The word 'Kei' translates to 'Light Automobile' in Japanese.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Kei cars specifically Kei trucks are small work utility vehicles that are becoming sought after in the United States especially among the rural population.
        </p>
    
        <p>
            Some of the reasons Kei Trucks are becoming more popular in America is because of their practicality, their fuel efficiency, & their low cost of maintenance. 
        </p>
    
        <p>
            I've noticed a lot of people buying these and figured that using a Kei Truck would be fitting for this type of business and design.
        </p>

        <p>
            To make this I took inspiration from automotive website designs I found online along with some personal knowledge about the type of information you want to see when your shopping for cars online and this is what I came up with.
        </p>
        <p>
            I spent a few hours designing the layout and spend another hour or two making the logo look as cool as possible.  I used 'League gothic' for the big 'IMPORTER' text on top and translated 'car imported' to Japanese text and placed it right underneath.
