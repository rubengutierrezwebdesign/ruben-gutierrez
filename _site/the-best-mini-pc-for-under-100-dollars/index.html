    Hello my name is Ruben Gutierrez and I've been working on computers for a while now. All together I've probably owned about fifty or so computers throughout the last 20 years ranging from $1500 laptops to free desktops I've received from clients and friends. In that time I've pretty good at learning what to look for at understanding the pros and cons between different brands, price ranges, and features. 
</p>

<h2>The Computer I Want My New Computer To Be Like</h2>
<p>
    My main computer for a while now has been a mid range laptop I purchased from a major retailer for $600 brand new. This laptop has a very capable 6 core CPU (Ryzen 5500U) that idles at 2.1GHz with boosted speeds of 4Ghz, basically it can handle almost anything without a drop in performance. As a website developer my daily workflow involves having about 30 different tabs open on 3 instances of Google Chrome while simultaneously switching between half a dozen different design tools. Needless to say a new budget friendly computer could not keep up with. 
</p>

<h2>Why I Want This computer. and What I Was Looking For In My New PC</h2>
<p>
    While it may sound absurd now that I think about it I really wanted a computer that could match my laptop for a fraction of the price. The reasons for buying this new computer is to improve my workflow by taking advantage of the large 28 inch monitor and desk I've been piecing together.
</p>
<p>
   Performance & Speed -
</p>

<p>
    Affordability. Max budget of $50 - $80 dollars.
</p>

<p>
    A computer capable of handling heavy multitasking without performance issues (lag, freeze, etc.).  Some of the software I use when I'm working are programs like VSCode, Inkscape, GIMP, Figma etc. basically a lot of programs for making websites and web content. These programs don't require a lot of RAM & CPU to run individually but when their used in a work environment where you're constantly switching from window to window it can create issues especially on computers with lower end chip sets.
</p>

<h2>Researching The Computer</h2>
<p>
    After doing research for a few days I came to a few conclusions. 
</p>

<p>
    I didn't want a laptop due to the fact that most laptop sold in my budgets price range usually contain low end chip sets that are designed for mostly internet surfing and emails.
</p>

<p>
    Their are hardly any Good computers for this price range that can do what I need to do, which is website development.
</p>

<h2>Purchasing The Lenovo ThinkCentre M715Q</h2>
<p>
    After countless hours of typing in variations of "cheapest mini pc" into Google and comparing tens of dozens of CPU's I can confidently say that I ended up purchasing the The Lenovo ThinkCentre M715Q. This Computer has a Ryzen 5 2400GE CPU chip set and 8 Gigs of RAM. This may not sound like much to people. and let me tell you this computer works almost as good as my $600 laptop.
</p>
<p>
    This computer is 7 years old and performance better than laptops that came out this year. If you're looking for something
