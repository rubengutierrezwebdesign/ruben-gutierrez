            <p>
                Email marketing is a marketing strategy where you collect emails from people in order to send out bulk emails containing information about your business directly to their inbox. Email marketing is an effective strategy for reaching out to customers because email is still one of the most widely used form of communication even today.

            <p>
                The tricky part about email marketing is actually getting the emails in the first place. To get an email list started you should probably start by asking the customers you already have. Onces you've reached your limit there you can move on to a more streamlined approach of collecting email addresses. This leads me to my next point, offering free resources on your website in exchange for an email address.

Whatever value you feel like you can add to someone life make sure to write it down, package it, and offer it somewhere online in exchange for their email.

            Another benefit of offering free resources on your website are the potential for backlinks. Backlinks are links given by another website that send users from one website to another.
