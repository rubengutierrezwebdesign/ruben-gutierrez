                        <p class="_14 pr-5">The first website you invest in is usually not the one you want.Theirs a lot of reasons as to why you might not be satisfied with your website appearance, things like the platform it was built on, the tools used to make it, and the designer you hired can all be factors. At first this may not be a problem but the further you progress in your online marketing campaigns the more it can hold you back. It's pretty well documented that good design establishes trust with it's users so in order for you to get as much as you can from your website it's imperative that at some point you invest a bit of money and time into it's appearance.

                    <h3>How You Can Benefit From A Website</h3>
                    <p>One thing I like to stress is that you don't need to own a store or to even have a business to get something out of a website, ordinary people look you and I can benefit a lot too from investing in in one. One of the ways a website can help you is through networking. Whether you're goals are 'business orientated' or you're working on a personal passion, highlighting you're skills, goals, and knowledge on a website can give you access to doors that might have not been available otherwise. </p>

                    <h3>Having A Website Can Open Up Oppurtunities</h3>
                    <p>Take this example for instance. When I first began learning about these things I didn't really understand what I was getting into. The only thing I knew was that I enjoyed being able to solve problems using computers and their was some decent money in doing so. The more I experimented with web design the more I began to realize how effective it could be. One of the first websites I made landed me a few high end clients and a couple of really good job opportunities. The fact that people came searching for me offering me a different path amazed me!

                <h2>Content Creation</h2>

                <h3>Why Content Is Important</h3>
                <p>Words are important they have a lot of meaning and help us categories things. Words are also how the internet works. Think about it, when you want to know more about a topic the first thing you do is type the words or phrases associated with that topic into a search bar in order to learn more. The same principals apply with your business, the more information you have about a location the more people will find you. </p>

                <p>When I began my journey to become a website designer all I really wanted to do was to make money using my interest in technology. Now that I've gotten a bit older I've come to understand a little more about the world and how I want to make it better.
