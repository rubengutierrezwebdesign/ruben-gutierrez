        <h2>Where is La Habra, California</h2>
        <p class="mw-500">
            La Habra, California is a city in the United States of America. La Habra is located in the Orange County California region. It sits at the northern edge of the county bordering cities in the Los Angles County Area.

    <div class="mw-50">
        <h3>How Did La Habra Get it's Name?</h3>
        <p>
            La Habra officially got it's name from Mariano Reyes Roldan a farmer who was given a land grant by the Mexican Government in the early 1800's. The area was initially named by Don Gaspar de Portol√°, a Spanish Explorer, who encountered the region when he was making his way up from San Diego into Monterey along the California coast in what historians would later refer to as the Portola Expedition.
        </p>

    <div class="mw-50">
        <h3>What Does La Habra Mean?</h3>
        <p>
            The name <strong>"La Habra"</strong> means "the opening" or "the pass through the hills" in Spanish. This is in reference to the mountainous geography surrounding it and to it's flat position between Chino Hills & Puente Hills.
        </p>

    <div class="mw-50">
        <h3>La Habra As A City</h3>

    <!-- Early La Habra Economy -->
   <div class="mw-50">
     <h3>Early Economy in La Habra Oil & Avocados</h3>
    <p>
        In it's early years La Habra greatly benefited from being rich with citrus fruit and avocados. These fruit where so ubiquitous in the area that it made La Habra one of the top producers for these crops in the entire world.
    </p>
    <p>
        Another factor that contributed to the fast development of La Habra was oil. Oil was discovered in La Habra in the late 1800's in the The West Coyote Hills area. The area would later be known as the The West Coyote Oil Field. This oil field produced about 250 Millio barrels of oil from 1920 all the way up until 1994 and was one of the largest known oil fields in the middle of the 20th century.

        <h3>Richard Nixon A La Habra Local</h3>
        <p>
            La Habra is also where Americas 37th President, Richard Milhous Nixon's career got started. In 1938 Richard Nixon opened up his first law office located in the center of La Habra Blvd. Due to safety concerns the building was torn down in 1992 but a plaque honoring his legacy remains where the legal structure once stood.
        </p>
        <p>
            Despite all the controversy surrounding Richard Nixon and the Cold War their is positive things he did for the American people. One of those things he did was sign into law the Social Security Act of 1972. This law which greatly expanded Medicare especially helped people with renal failure which is currently the 9th leading cause of death amongst Americans.

    <!-- Electric Railway-->
    <div class="mw-50">
        <h3>La Habra Was Part of The Largest Electric Railways On The Planet For Decades</h3>
        <p>
            Did you know that at one point La Habra was part of the longest electric railway in the entire world. The Pacific Electric Railway which was active from 1901 to 1965 was a mostly passenger railway that was completely powered by electricity and covered a little over 1,000 miles of track. This electric transportation system that sounds like something out of a science fiction movie connected people from major cities in Southern California like Los Angeles to the more urban and rural population surrounding them. This railway was one of the major reasons for rapid development in Southern California and held the title of long

            Improvements in transportation and rapid population growth would later make the railway impractical for the average person as buses and cars began to be the preferred mode of transportation in the region.
        </p>

        <p>
            Can you imagine what it must have felt like to be alive sometime in the early 1900's taking an electric train all the way from Rialto to Long Beach without all the freeway noises? I've regularly made that trip from the Coast to Redlands and constantly miss out on the scenary because I'm too focused on avoidng the speeding traffic the whole time.
