<h2>What is Search Engine Optimization?</h2>
<p>
    Search Engine Optimization or SEO is the process of making adjustments to your website both on and off its pages to improve its rankings in search engines like Google, Bing, and Yahoo.  Hello! My name is Ruben, a website developer. I've been making webpages that rank high in Google and other search engines for a few years and I'd like to help you get your website found online.
</p>
<h3>The Importance of Optimizing your Website For Search Engines in Brea, California</h3>
<p class="_14">
    Search engines are very useful and can help you learn more about anything. You can use search engines to help you understand educational topics like math, science, and history. While these tools are great for deep diving into any particular subject they can also inform you about some pretty useful things. Another reason search engines are very useful is to help you and other people learn more about things going on around you. Search engines can help you find individuals, products, events, services,businesses etc. you name it. For these reasons especially the latter it's important that you optimize your website if you want to be found in and around the Brea, California area.
</p>
<h3>How Google and Most Search Engines Work</h3>

<p>Trying to understand how search engines like Google work can seem a bit complicated, but just like anything else when you break down the process step by step it becomes a lot easier to wrap your head around.
</p>

<p>
    The way search engines produce relevant and helpful information about topics you're interested in begins the moment you type your question into the search bar and press enter. From there Google pulls webpages from it's database containing similar keywords and phrases based on what you typed. If you're wondering how Google has these webpages in its database it's through a process known as "crawling, discovery, and indexing". If you'd like to know more about how it works read the section below. Once Google has collected all the webpages containing those keywords it determines which ones are the most useful based on known and unknown variables. After determining which webpages are best suited to answer your question Google creates a ranked list of links to those webpages which is what you end up seeing. 
</p>
<h2>How To Get Your Website in Google Search Results</h2>
<p>
    Getting your website and webpages listed in Google Search Results is fairly simple. All you really need to do is create a decent amount of content and submit it in the Search Console. If you do these two things you can get your website listed in a few days. If you'd like to know more about the process I wrote a little bit about it here "How to get Your Website Listed in Google". This guide will elaborate the process further and can help you start taking action today!

</p>
<p>
