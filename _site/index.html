            <p>
                Hello, my name is Rubén Gutierrez and I am a Website Developer from La Habra, California. I've been building website for a while now and I am profoundly passionate about using technology to help others do what they really want to do.

        <h2>How I Got Started With Technology</h2>

        <p>
            My interest with technology started when I received my first computer for Christmas when I was around ten years old. The first computer I ever received was the heaviest HP desktop that the local Best Buy had to offer. When I wasn't taking the whole thing apart to clear the dust out I was researching ways to make it run as smooth as possible.
        </p>

        <p>
            It was at around this time in the early 2000's the internet really began to take off, advancements in technology and the global economy made it possible for the average person like myself to own a personal computer. While mostly a good time this early era of the modern internet was plagued with a lot security problems that created a lot repair work and made life for most PC owners inconvenient.
        </p>

        <p>
            Despite all that everyone I knew was both excited and invested in the web and very quickly I found myself in a situation where I'd learned a lot of lucrative in demand skills at a very young age. For around ten years I stayed busy working on devices that belonged to family, friends, and whoever they knew. I spent a lot of time in my teenage years making my paper route money by restoring bricked devices, recovering sensitive data, and learning to implement security features. As time went by software companies began to solve a lot of the problems that plagued early computer owners so repair work began to disappear. 
        </p>

        <p>
            As IT work began to decline I turned my attention towards website development and design. Today my focus is on helping people improve their online presence through web technology. Below are some of the skills and technologies I've learned in the past few years. 
        </p>

    <div class=" container paa-50">
        <h2>Technologies I'm Familiar With</h2>
        <p>
            For me technology is a constantly changing field that requires you to quickly learn new skills to adapt and overcome different obstacle. With that said I also think it's important to let people know some of the exact tools you're familiar with in order to help them gauge you're understanding and whether you can help them.
        </p>
        <div class="br">
            <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
            The foundation of the internet but really HTML has given me the ability to turn my simple ideas into something tangible. HTML allows me to present my creativity in ways that social media and other platforms just can't match. It still baffles me to think that this seemingly simple markup language has the capacity to provide soo much assistance in the forms of tools and information for anyone throughout the world.
        </p>

        <h3>Static Site Generators</h3>
        <p>Not exactly a speicifc technology but overall static site generator like jekyll and 11ty have not only made it easier for me to maintain larger and more complex projects but it's also helped me learn the ins and outs of front end design. t easier to maintain my projects at scale. These have brought about an effiecienty and order into my life almost absolutely free. Tools like Jekyll and 11ty </p>

        <h3>WordPress</h3>
        <p>One of these most valuable skills I've learned as a freelance website developer has been WordPress. With 40 percent of the website online being ran on WordPress it goes without saying that WordPress is a corner stone of the internet. Learning that has made it possible for me to find employment </p>
