    <p>
        Today I made the decisions of moving my website over from Jekyll to 11ty. The move started because I ran into a situation that I had never encountered while using Jekyll. 
    </p>

    <h2>Learning Jekyll Forced Me To Become A Better Website Developer</h2>
    <p>
        I've been using Jekyll for a while now and learning it was one of the best decisions I've ever made. Jekyll was the first static site generator I learned how to use mainly because I wanted to host my website for free on Github. I'll always appreciate Jekyll because through the process of learning this software I also learned all the little details that requires creating and deploying a website from the bottom up Before learning Jekyll I relied on various types of templating software like WordPress themes to build out my web projects, while these technologies are great they don't offer the level of customization that I was looking for. 

    <h3>What Happened That Made Me Switch</h3>
    <p> 
        I didn't really plan on learning how to use a new static site generator but the longer my Jekyll site was taking to load after making some edits the more I began to consider finding alternative options. I finally decided to make the move when my laptop froze for almost an entire minute. At first I thought it was my hardware because the laptop I was using at that moment was a little older, but after running some tests on my higher performing PC's a little later I realized it wasn't a problem with my laptop at all It was the software I was using and what I was expecting from it. 
        Up until now I had been using Jekyll for smaller websites that focused more on design or very text heavy SEO projects which is why I never ran into performance issues. Now that I'm creating larger projects with more code and assets I've quickly hit it's limitations.
    </p>

    <h3>Jekyll Is For Smaller Website Projects</h3>
    <p class="mb-100">     
        Through some research I learned that longer build times are a very common problem when it comes to Jekyll projects especially when it comes to Jekyll projects with a lot of content. I even read about a person who's site had around 100 pages and their build time was about a half an hour. Theirs a lot of well informed opinions on the web design forums indicating that the reason Jekyll builds take a long time is because Ruby on Rails, the main language used to write Jekyll, is outdated or that file configuration plays a big role but I couldn't really tell you anything for sure. What I can tell you is that the way Jekyll is built makes it a fast and reliable solutions for website developer and designer even to this day.
    </p>

    <h2>Choosing A New Static Site Generator</h2>
    <p>
        One of the reasons I never considered learning another static site generators was because I thought It was going to take me a long time to learn how to use it. My first move was Googling a list of static site generates and comparing them based on their features. Onces I became a little more familiar with them I was able to dig a bit deeper and I was able to find charts comparing build times among some of the most popular static site generators which helped me narrow my selections down. After some further consideration I was able to finally make a decsions.
    </p>

    <h3>Why I Chose 11ty As My New Static Site Generator</h3>
    <p>
        Theirs a countless static site generator options out their but 11ty is the way to go for me. Other than the speed the other determingin factors where file types and ease.
    </p>

    <h3>Some of the things I struggled with</h3>
    <p>
        While 11ty is far better for what I'm trying to do their is a bit of a learning curve when it comes to it. One of the things that.
