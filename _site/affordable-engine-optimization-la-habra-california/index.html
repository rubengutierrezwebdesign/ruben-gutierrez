        Are you looking for affordable website design services in the La Habra, California area? I can help.
    </p>
    <p>
        A lot of people make the assumption that you need a ton of money to start a website. A while that is true if you go about it in a conventual way it doesn't have to be with this offer you're about read.
    </p>
    <h2>What Is The Cost of Running A Website?</h2>
    <p>
        You see their are a lot of fees and commitment to developing a website.  To start off you need a domain name that can cost you anywhere from $10 a year all the way up to $100' if not $1,000's. Then you have server space which can cost you anywhere from $5 to $20 a month just to rent out. Just to get the requirements for a website you're looking at a minimum of $100 a year in the essential.  Then finally you have to hire someone to make all the pages and content and that's where you really end up having to pay an arm and a leg. 
    </p>

    <h2>A Better Website Buying Experience</h2>

    <p>
        What I'm offering is a simple website package that you'd only have to pay for once. This website package would only cost you a one time fee plus around $10 a year just to maintain.
    </p>
    <h3>Why The Prices Are So Low</h3>
    <p>
        The reasons I offer my services at such a low price is because I have a business to run but also because I feel like theirs not a lot people around me who have access to these types of tools that can change their life for the better.
    </p>

    <p>
        Websites and Web Design can help you network outside of the people you already know and when you pair it with Google My Business and 
    </p>

    <p>
        The more well presenting someone is the more likely they are to get business 
    </p>
    <h3>Pros</h3>
    <p>
        Custom Website Design - Custom website means that I will make your website look exactly the way you want.
    </p>
    <p>
        Theirs no way to get a more customized website then to learn how to code.  While site builders offer a decent amount of tools to help you design your website they do have their limitations in what they can do.
    </p>
    <p>
        Site builder design tools where made with ease of use and convince in mind.  While this does help the general user of these site builders it also limits them to what they can do. 
    </p>
    <h3>Cons</h3>
    <p>
        If you're looking to just have something nice up on the web with a few pages then the cons of this package probably won't bother you.
